# Experiment 2 - Dynamic React UX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an experiment to see about creating a React app entirely from a UX.

React is great for creating apps but it takes forever to get the simpliest thing
done.  This experiment aims to discover the mechanics and UX by which a React
app can be created from a browser based UI.

## Objectives

* React classes can be created dynamically
* `props` can be added to a class
* Work is serialized to the cloud (database)
* `render` tree can be constructed from existing components and primitives
* `state` can be bound to components
* Routing pages to components
* Handlers can be added to a class
* Browsing existing components
* Visualize the result of a component
