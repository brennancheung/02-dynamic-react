# Experiment 2 - Dynamic React UX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an experiment to see about creating a React app entirely from a UX.

React is great for creating apps but it takes forever to get the simpliest thing
done.  This experiment aims to discover the mechanics and UX by which a React
app can be created from a browser based UI.

## Objectives

* ~~React classes can be created dynamically~~
* ~~`props` can be added to a class~~
* ~~`render` tree can be constructed from existing components and primitives~~
* `state` can be bound to components
* Handlers can be added to a class
* Browsing existing components
* Visualize the result of a component
* Routing pages to components
* Work is serialized to the cloud (database)
